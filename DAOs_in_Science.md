# DAOs in science: why, who, and how

Nowadays we see severe challenges and unpredictable speed of changes in all spheres of the human environment, which makes traditional organization structures way less effective. Their decisions are made by central authorities, and the price of their mistake can be too high. Very often they lack public control, so the consequences of the wrong step may stay undetected for a long time, which results in a sustainability decrease. 

Why DAO and what it gives

These limitations of traditional public organization forms call for new approaches. That is the reason why decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) emerge and become a reasoned choice for like-minded people to achieve common goals.
-DAO has no central government: the process of decision-making is divided between individual tokenholders who have direct votes on every matter.
-All decisions are open to public view, which makes them transparent and provides a means of reputation impact.
-DAO is designed as an instrument for a bottom-up management approach: people feel that they have real participation in their entity which motivates them to act responsibly.  
-Rules of DAO may be set in smart contracts and are fulfilled automatically.

Initially, DAO appeared in blockchain and cryptocurrency companies, but now the form is quickly spreading in manufacturing, finance, art, and, importantly, science.


What is wrong with centralized science

There are specific problems science is facing now:
Centralization and dependence upon state-run institutions: regulators decide what will be the subject of scientific interest.
Biased grant system: the higher your rating in the world science community hierarchy is, the more chances you have to get money.
Unaccessible information: publications in most affluent scientific journals are expensive.
Lack of transparency: corporations and ministers lobby for their interests, decreasing the effectiveness of the world science community. 
The “publish or perish” reality: funding straightly depends upon the number of articles you publish, so researchers have to struggle to receive an estimation of their colleagues.
Here we write about all these problems in more detail. That is how science DAOs come to solve them.


How DAOs solve problems of a centralized science

Blockchain instruments provide for more independence of science DAO in comparison with traditional organizations.

To start with, science DAOs have various possibilities for alternative financing. Crowdfunding is only one of the options; others are tokens staking and utility NFT sale. For DAO, tokens are often like shares in a digital world: owning a token gives you the right to receive dividends and/or vote. As for utility NFT, it is a unique key that gives you access to the product: for example, it can work as a medication prescription that nobody can fake. Just imagine the group of researchers developing a new drug and getting funds from patients that can potentially benefit from it. And after its successful launch, DAO can get a part of its money back based on points of more flexible monetization. Business models in DAOs can include well thought out tokenomics that provides different benefits for all the participants according to the specific algorithms - smart-contracts. 

Secondly, DAO, using smart contracts, can provide for a direct connection between a scientist and his peer reviewer. Expensive agents like science journals with their contradictory demands are no longer needed. Any scientist can quickly and easily interact with other researchers in his respective field. Science becomes more accessible and verified.

Thirdly, in the open science world, more effective alternative instruments can appear to measure the reputation of the scientist. Now, the h-index is used which encourages scientists to multiply publications only to increase it and to get access to funds. This has nothing in common with scientific interest. On the contrary, personal portraits of scientists in DeSci may take into account not only publications, but reviews, mentoring, participation in other authors' research, and how one is involved in public activity concerning her subject. New approach to confirm the authorship - digital signatures (e.g., NFTs) do open-source products and articles more secure as ever. Authorship also becomes more secure due to NFT. 

Ultimately, the DAO system can stimulate like-minded scientists from all over the world to unite in online coworking think-spaces and cloud laboratories, which can empower fundamental and technical advances. With a community-driven approach, science is to become open.


DAOs in life science and biotech

Biotech and life science are branches that need to develop fast and be quick and flexible. Centralized models do not help the science community to meet growing challenges. That is why the ideas of decentralized science become more and more popular in this sphere. There is a number of examples of how they strive to change knowledge infrastructure, scientific publishing, funding, and research process. You can also join DAOs and support their work.

The Molecule
The Molecule is one of the two main software developers that create biotech and life science DAO (the second one is SCINET). It works as a decentralized research funding platform joining together researchers and potential investors. For now, Molecule has over 250 research projects listed, over 4500 DAO community members, and 3 Bio DAOs with over $10M in their network. It is like a great hub for DAOs seeking financing and investors in need of insightful biotech startups, such as early-stage therapeutics research that can bring novel drugs to patients, among them research on Alzheimer's disease antibodies and psoriasis treatment.

VitaDAO
VitaDAO is a biotech decentralized organization specializing in longevity, the extension of human life, and health span. They finance early-stage research in this field, such as discovering a novel autophagy activator or a large-scale study analyzing medical records from over 4 million individuals to find associations between certain drug prescriptions and longevity. VitaDAO stakes Vita tokens which can be used to vote on and govern money allocation. Vita tokens can be bought or earned through collaboration. VitaDAO has over 1300 token holders for now. As Vita's mission is to strive for longevity, they propose that their token supply cap “may only increase if someone lives beyond Jeanne Louise Calment’s lifespan. Jeanne Louise Calment was the longest-lived person in history”.

LabDAO
LabDAO is a community created to share both computational and wet-lab tools and to make them accessible to all its members. It connects wet-lab researchers, who work with chemical and biological materials, with dry-lab researchers, who work with computation and engineering. That helps bioscientists and engineers to collaborate, share data and save funds on resources and equipment. Thus LabDAO strives to create an ecosystem that is designed to destroy barriers between research and life sciences, such as high price, commercial confidentiality, and non-reproducible data.

AntidoteDAO
AntidoteDAO is a decentralized organization focusing on democratizing cancer research. Like in many other DAOs, one can buy tokens and NFTs which enable the owner to vote on funding proposals. Not only Antidote gives financial support to charitable organizations that help cancer patients and studies, but also accumulates the seed fund for groups of scientists making research in this field.

CureDao
CureDAO is a community-owned open-source platform to discover how foods, drugs, and millions of other factors affect human health. Despite the fast increase of big data implementation in medical science we still have no aggregate picture of how to manage lifestyle to prevent health problems. The mission of CureDAO is to fight these limitations by collecting and analyzing data on health conditions and their connection with various factors and interventions. Any individual can buy tokens for data and intellectual property or earn them by making and monetizing custom plug-ins. 


The BellingThreats DAO: Why we choose the Public Health

Now, we are launching the BellingThreats DAO for decentralized research initiatives in Health Sciences on the GOSH blockchain. 

The Public Health Sciences (PHS) area is one of the most struggling fields of human science. 
-Resources in it are highly consolidated around Academia and Regulators or “highly promising” research entities such as biotechnology, comparative clinical trials of pharmacological substances, and so on. 
-Due to numerous conflicts of interest it is not infrequent that provoking but clarifying research findings in public health area are censored by regulators, potential stakeholders, sponsors, foundations, or even by the chief of the research group.
-At the same time, inadequate evaluation of study designs for large-scale studies leads to funds waste and obscuring policies.
-Besides, public health problems are to be treated quickly, whereas the centralized system of local and global healthcare regulators is abundant and clumsy. The old hierarchy of knowledge, along with its barriers, has inflicted great harm on public health, e.g. contributed a lot to the number of covid deaths.
-Public health problems need simultaneous answers, which can be given only by proactive research analyses and small-field exploratory investigations not only by big players. 


How we are going to work 

BellingThreats DAO is dealing at first with study proposals in the public health area. It is going to engage professional, educated and patient communities to participate in study proposals evaluation before raising funds. Members of the community will participate in voting that will occur in specific manner to avoid fraud. Rewarding by tokens is provided not only for people's activity in study proposals review but also for writing comments, proposal reassessment, the reappraisal of new questions, and posting preliminary observations. Approved study proposals will raise a fund and track the research process to its results. 

We use the zero-knowledge model for results reporting. That means an equal attitude towards all the results without excess filters or censorship. There is no prejudice against “unimportant” or “non-significant” results, nor fear of “too resonant”, “provocative” or “unexpected” ones. Through a transparent review process, the science community will have more chances to avoid systematic errors in the early stages of the research planning.

As for the funding, we maintain that only decentralized fundraising can give scientists the necessary independence from authorities. We believe that our approach will lead to an increase in high-quality research proposals from scientists widely distributed among various regions, despite their affiliation, status in academia and industry, or absence of publications in noticeable scientific journals. 

This will prevent corruption and help make harm-reducing programs in public health area way more effective. Thus, we will contribute to more quick and adaptable public healthcare in which patients will have their vote to approve initiatives they are interested in. We call all concerned scientists, doctors, patients for joining our social media.
