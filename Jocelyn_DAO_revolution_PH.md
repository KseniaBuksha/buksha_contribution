# The Jocelyn DAO: turning Public Health agile
Nowadays, the Public Health area faces serious problems. Many of them emerge from the imperfect process of research funding. Medics, patients, scientists, and the general public deal with these problems the hard way. The clumsy healthcare regulation causes poor healthcare access, which is bad at any time but crucial during pandemics and humanitarian disasters. To help the PH area meet these challenges, we are launching the Jocelyn DAO for decentralized research initiatives in Health Sciences on the Git Open Source Holder (GOSH) blockchain.
What is Jocelyn DAO
Jocelyn is a decentralized organization based on the GOSH blockchain and created for study proposals review and financial support for research initiatives. We start with Public Health related studies, but we have great plans to scale across other scientific fields. 
We support the DeSci movement and believe that it can revolutionize science. We aim to contribute to science democratization as well, via brand new system for study proposals review and fundraising.
Our mission and goals
We have named our DAO after Jocelyn Bell Burnell, the female astrophysicist. She played the main role in the discovery of pulsars, which brought the Nobel Prize to her thesis supervisor but not for herself, because she was a woman and a graduate student at the time.
In the PH area, such kind of injustice is common. And it’s not only about women in science but about all the institutional failures that prevent important results from being published, reviewed, financed, and popularized. The research of independent scientists not affiliated with Academia or Regulators has far fewer chances to be reviewed and funded. Due to numerous conflicts of interest, provoking but clarifying research is often censored by regulators, potential stakeholders, sponsors, and foundations, and it greatly affects the area’s effectiveness. As a result, Public Health does not receive all the benefits that science can give.
The Jocelyne DAO community is going to improve the way things are. Big players should not push aside small-field exploratory investigations. Public Health problems need simultaneous answers, which can be given only by proactive research analyses. We are here to bring all this to public attention.
The Jocelyn DAO’s mission is to disseminate transparent and independent research in the field of Public Health Sciences, but this is just as the first step.  Furthermore, Jocelyn aims to redefine the way research proposals are reviewed, finded, and conducted in various, more broad scientific fields. 
One of our goals is to contribute to more quick and adaptable public healthcare in which patients will have their vote to approve initiatives they are interested in.
 
How do we work
1.Study proposal submit
Scientists post requests to review their study proposals. 
We are going to deal first with study proposals in the Public Health area.The Jocelyn DAO is the first DAO in the long-term scalable DeSci strategy that will, with time, include several corresponding DAOs dealing with other Health Sciences. Through a transparent review process, the science community will have more chances to avoid systematic errors in the early stages of the research planning. 
2.Communities voting
Jocelyn plans to engage professional, educated, and patient communities to participate in study proposals evaluation before raising funds.
Members of the community will participate in voting that will occur in a specific manner to avoid fraud. In GOSH, each member will be able to vote with tokens on the user's GOSH wallet. Thus, each significant action, such as a pull request of a study proposal or review resume, as well as the commitment of research results - will determine the allocation of some amount of tokens from voters to those, who've done this action. Allocated tokens could be used as liquidity - as a fund for research or as a reward for posted results if all terms for it are matched. These terms will be announced in GOSH's update release.
3.Fundrasing
All approved initiatives have an opportunity to get funding.
We maintain that only decentralized fundraising can give scientists the necessary independence from authorities. Being the member of the Joselyn community you can donate to the Initiative you love. Instead of earning from the Initiative itself, you will get compensation with GOSH tokens and have the opportunity to participate in intellectual property ownership. 
4.Results Reporting
We use the zero-knowledge model for results reporting. 
That means an equal attitude towards all the results without excess filters or censorship. There is no prejudice against “unimportant” or “non-significant” results, nor fear of “too resonant”, “provocative” or “unexpected” ones. The only thing - the commitment of the study report should be approved by the community as corresponding to not-fraudulent, and enough transparent - truth, truth, and only truth about your study. Even if it is not so pretty because of different limitations or failures.
5.Media support of the research
Social Media workers authorized in the protocol observe active initiatives and react to them.
While conducting the research, scientists can do a “study diary” (rewarding with reputational tokens) and post the preliminary results. After final report publication and study proposal approval, during the process of the active initiative’s track and in the post-production period, Social Media observe the research for publication or external GR connection.
We believe that our approach will lead to an increase in high-quality research proposals from scientists widely distributed among various regions, despite their affiliation, status in academia and industry, or absence of publications in noticeable scientific journals.
 
Why you should join the Jocelyne DAO
If you are a scientist working on research in the PH area, you can join Jocelyne and take part in its decisions to:
 -get a transparent and unbiased review of your study proposal;
 -publish your results, whether they are significant or not;
 -get funding if your SP is approved by the community;
 -study results on well-reviewed proposals and thus learn more about current PH initiatives and reduce your costs.
If you are a member of Academia, Regulator, or another institution, you will also benefit from the Jocelyne DAO. You can get:
 -security, openness, and reputation for your authorship;
 -full free access to others’ research methodology and results;
 -risk assessment plan.
If you are a reviewer aspiring to impact the scientific agenda and to contribute to the science by giving your assessment to study proposals, you can join us to get value for your feedback.
If you are a student, a patient, or an enthusiast of Public Health, you can join Jocelyne to learn more about how health studies develop, and directly take part in the decisions. Yes, not only MDs are allowed (soon in the whitepaper here: https://gosh.sh)
DAO is an alternative and more honest way of growing reputations, rising funds, and bringing scientific results to the people. Together, we will prevent corruption and help make the research process more effective.
At the moment, we are preparing to release our platform. As soon as we are ready we’ll announce the launch via our social media. Now, we call all concerned scientists, doctors, patients, and enthusiasts to contribute to the DeSci idea and PH development by participating in the Jocelyne community here:
