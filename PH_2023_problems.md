# What's up for 2023 in Public Health, and how Open Science helps to cope

In 2020 we dreamed of the post-COVID era and were afraid that the happy time would never come. Now in 2023, we look back to 2020 with a sort of wise smirk. Now we know a lot of things that we would have preferred to never know. But that helps only partially because new challenges are coming thick and fast. Public Health in 2023 must be quick, agile, and reactive. Our opinion is that only decentralized science can make it up. We made a little list of the most topical challenges and how DeSci can fight them.

COVID and Lower respiratory infections
Yes, we sort of adapted with COVID – except for China, where the zero-Covid policy resulted in unprecedented lockdowns and then demonstrations across the country. As the government had to loosen restrictions, COVID cases skyrocketed in the basically non-immune and under-vaccinated Chinese population. 

The Economist estimated that as many as 1.5 million people in China could die from Covid in the coming months. Moreover, the cycling of the virus through hundreds of millions of people may drive it to further mutations which will possibly escape vaccination and strike people around the world.

Again, COVID is not alone anymore. In 2020 social distancing, masks and lockdowns declined the level of influenza and RSV, so many young children grew up without being exposed to these infections. Now they come back, and flu along with RSV grows across all ages and in many countries. Medics call this a “double burden” which will be critical in 2023.
We need more flu and COVID vaccines, especially for children, and better access to vaccination. We also need RSV vaccines, one of them is already on the way.

So, what can be done?

DeSci can make vaccines more available and popular
While states try to make vaccines accessible, Open Science can stimulate intersectional research to make the process of their creation and assessment more effective. With lower respiratory infections, the problem is that they mostly affect children, and regulators often retard working out childhood vaccination requirements. 

More data from all over the world about different aspects of vaccines' impact on children may help them play faster. Open Science also provides for new mechanisms of investing in immunization information systems, for medics to acquire all up-to-date info and for the general population to have more positive concerns and less prejudice.

Refugee crisis
War in Ukraine, though not the only reason for mass migration, added to the number of people who had to leave home. In 2022 the number of refugees in the world exceeded 100 million people for the first time in human history. It is 8% more than a year ago and more than twice that of ten years ago. Just imagine that one in eighty people in the world is a refugee. 

This trend can lead not only to hunger in different parts of the world but also to serious PH issues. People who run away from the war have no insurance and no money to buy it, they may face social exclusion which also prevents them from getting proper health care. Their previous history of poverty and hunger could have weakened their immune system. 

Migrants also face higher reproductive risk, their newborns and infants have higher death rates. Many suffer from mental issues, especially post-traumatic stress disorder, all types of anxiety, and depressive disorders. All migrants, not only war refugees, have higher chances to get their diagnosis out of time which makes treatment more complicated. How should we solve these problems?

DeSci can help refugees get access to healthcare
Open science does not stop wars. But it can make healthcare more accessible to those who had to leave their homes in Iraq, Syria, Ukraine, and other countries. Open Science mechanisms can boost research in Health Technologies to develop new cheap and effective diagnostics and treatments so that refugees could get them without loading a heavy burden on the healthcare system of the host country. 

The aim is not only to reduce the cost of consultation but also to make high-quality medical service open to the most vulnerable part of the world population. Decentralized instruments of financing allow communities all over the world to support healthcare research made for any specific healthcare need, e.g. prevention of diarrhea-associated deaths in refugee infants. Problems of underrepresented and vulnerable people and research made on them will become more visible to investors around the globe.

Burnout in health professionals
People who work in public health, especially hospital staff and emergencies, are always at higher risk of burnout. But the last few years have been especially demanding and stressful for them. Recent research shows that 63 percent of physicians surveyed reported at least one symptom of burnout at the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022, an increase from 44 percent in 2017. https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(22)00515-8/fulltext
Covid-19 has been a highly traumatic experience for doctors, nurses, EMTs, and their families. It has not gone away, and new challenges add to doctors' work overload. In 2022, hospitals were crowded since late summer: the abovementioned flu and RSV seem to lose their seasonal character. 

Monkeypox global outbreak resulted in reports from countries where the disease is not endemic. And even “good old” controlled infections managed to relive the past: several findings of polio were recorded, measles grew, Ebola was found in Africa, and cholera appeared in at least 29 countries, including those previously eradicated the disease, so cholera vaccines are by now in short supply.

So there is no wonder that not only doctors but all the specialists in PH at every level, from laboratory technicians to public health officials are deterred and exhausted. Many of them think of quitting. Meanwhile, we expect new outbreaks of various infections, either old or new ones. What are the possibilities to fight doctors’ burnout?

DeSci can provide technologies that help the overwhelmed medics
Open science empowers research on emerging technologies that can help reduce many of the burdens leading to a doctor's burnout. For example, one of the top challenges is information overload which urges a doctor to keep a lot of cases in mind. More research on clinical workflow technologies can help with this mental burden, allowing doctors to view, organize and track cases.

For the implementation in the PH sphere, the technology needs to be cheap. The quality of life of a health care specialist improves when she has access to results and critical patient images on her mobile devices from the secure app, which allows her to join her team from anywhere. In the Open Science world, it is easier to conduct and finance research on AI collaboration with doctors which can help reduce routine and enable faster and more accurate treatment decision-making.

Along with it, Open Science can provide replicable medical education technologies which give more accessible knowledge about burnout prevention for doctors and healthcare specialists around the globe.

All in all, in 2023 Public Health faces serious challenges, but DeSci is ready to meet them. It has the instruments to change the PH environment and solve problems.

Jocelyn DAO: how we can contribute

Jocelyn DAO is the first DAO created for decentralized research initiatives in Health Sciences on the Git Open Source Holder (GOSH) blockchain. We start with Public Health as the most critical point and with time we are going to include several corresponding DAOs dealing with other Health Sciences. 

Now Jocelyn DAO strives to encourage transparent intersectional research to make Public Health agile enough to meet coming challenges. All helpful initiatives will be noticed and carefully reviewed in the Jocelyn community, thus acquiring their chance to get funds. 

If you have an idea on how to make new medical technologies accessible and cheap right now, or if you are concerned about the subject, welcome to Jocelyn DAO. In the world of pandemics, political instability, and overloaded health professionals, decentralized organizations can change the game and make public healthcare fast and adaptable. We have no time to waste.

We call all scientists, doctors, patients, and enthusiasts to become part of our social media:
